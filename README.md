# Graphs
Implementation of Graph Data Structures

Graph is represented by nVertices and an Adjacency_List. 

These methods are implemented.

BFS(start);
DFS();
Dijkistra's
Presence of a cycle using DFS traversal;
TopologicalSort()
TransposeGraph()

Note : This implementation works for both directed and undirected graphs. Whether the graph is directed or not is specified while creating a graph.
